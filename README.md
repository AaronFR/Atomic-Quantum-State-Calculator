Calculates the quantum properties of elements
Primarily:
- Calculating the electronic configuration (ground state)
- Rydberg equation: wavelength of photon emitted in a transition
- Absorption (Hydrogen-like atoms only: those with only 1 electron)
- Get element from atomic configuration (RUDIMENTARY PROTOTYPE)
